    <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>
    <p>The best lasagna recipe is made with ingredients that you know, and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese Filling - For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
        <li>Meat - I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
        <li>Sauce - To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil Pasta - Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Prepare Meat Sauce - Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Combine Cheese Mixture - Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer and Bake - Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
